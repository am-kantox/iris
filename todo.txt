Fixes:
UI:
. Modify Scrollbar style in methods col > looks good now, change later maybe
. make all css classes consistent. use hyphens instead of underscores

Elixir:
. Filter duplicates before generating calls - selecting Jason app in UI
. handle recursive code
. Condense auto generated inline methods into parent method


Features:
. show documentation
. make the nodes in graph clickable & show popups (with documentation and other info)
. expand paths by clicking on nodes in graph - maybe a button for this? like play |> button
. global git revision changing option (re-render whole UI based on git revision [branch, commit] basis)
