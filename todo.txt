UI:
. Modify Scrollbar style in methods col > looks good now, change later maybe
. make all css classes consistent. use hyphens instead of underscores
. reset graph when app is changed. sometimes edges of prev graph remain

Elixir:
. Reference application in module. It's null right now. - to navigate in UI when method is clicked
. Filter duplicates before generating calls
. handle recursive code
